# Java Programming Fundamentals	- Assessment
 
This is my GitHub repository for my Java assessment.

### Review questions ###

**1. What did you like about this project?**

   This project allowed me to gain more understanding on object oriented programming (OOP) by getting more hands-on.

**2. What did you struggle with in this project?**

   The instructions/comments indicated in the assessment repository were vague so I had problems understanding the expected functionalities and returns of the methods to be implemented. The additional challenges were tough but interesting. I struggled with the nesting of List and hashmap to access courseGrade, but the sense of accomplishment that I got when the correct output was shown, was great.

**3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?**

   More elaboration on the methods to be implemented, would be appreciated.
